As small and large organizations rapidly innovate their operations with data-driven, predictive algorithms, ethics has become a buzz word for technologists. Data scientists, business leaders and policy makers are actively trying to address questions such as “what does it mean for an algorithm to be fair?”; “how do predictive algorithms affect the various roles within an organization?” and “can we make the algorithms transparent? Or explainable?” What is all this algorithmic ethics discussion all about? Who is doing something about it? More importantly, what does it mean for big data practitioners? Drawing from relevant studies and publications such as the [IEEE Ethically Aligned Design](https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/) guidelines and [UK government's data ethics framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework), this talk will begin with a broad discussion of the critical algorithmic ethics issues. The speaker will also present some of the practical steps to address these issues, including a case study (from right here in British Columbia, Canada) that demonstrate how ethics can be integrated into the design of big data systems.

Public service broadcasters have a special commitment to report on the diversity of the society and to enriching people's lives through different opinions and new perspectives. With recommendation algorithms being accused to promote filter bubbles (Pariser, 2011), Public Service Media (PSM) has to pay special attention to the promotion of diversity among its users.
In this presentation, we will cover the efforts undertaken by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to promote the use of recommender systems among its members on the first hand, and to promote public service values on the other hand.
